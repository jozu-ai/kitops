### What is KitOps?

KitOps is a packaging, versioning, and sharing system for AI/ML projects that uses open standards so it works with the AI/ML, development, and DevOps tools you are already using, and can be stored in your enterprise container registry.

KitOps creates a ModelKit for your AI/ML project which includes everything you need to reproduce it locally or deploy it into production. You can even **selectively unpack a ModelKit** so different team members can save time and storage space by only grabbing what they need for a task. Because ModelKits are immutable, signable, and live in your existing container registry they're easy for organizations to track, control, and audit.

ModelKits simplify the handoffs between data scientists, application developers, and SREs working with LLMs and other AI/ML models. Teams and enterprises use KitOps as a secure storage throughout the AI/ML project lifecycle.

Use KitOps to speed up and de-risk all types of AI/ML projects:
* Predictive models
* Large language models
* Computer vision models
* Multi-modal models
* Audio models
* etc...

### üá™üá∫ EU AI Act Compliance üîí
For our friends in the EU - ModelKits are the perfect way to create a library of model versions for EU AI Act compliance because they're tamper-proof, signable, and auditable.


### üòç What's New? ‚ú®

* üö¢ First Look: Create a **[runnable container from a ModelKit](https://tinyurl.com/5b76p5u3)** with one command!
* ü•Ç Get the most out of KitOps' ModelKits by using them with the **[Jozu Hub](https://jozu.ml/)** repository. Or, continue using ModelKits with your existing OCI registry (even on-premises and air-gapped).
* ‚õëÔ∏è [KitOps works great with Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/09/16/enhance-llms-instructlab-kitops) InstructLab and Quay.io products


### Features

* üéÅ **[Unified packaging](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/intro.html):** A ModelKit package includes models, datasets, configurations, and code. Add as much or as little as your project needs.
* üè≠ **[Versioning](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/cli-reference.html#kit-tag):** Each ModelKit is tagged so everyone knows which dataset and model work together.
* üîí **[Tamper-proofing](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/spec.html):** Each ModelKit package includes an SHA digest for itself, and every artifact it holds.
* ü§© **[Selective-unpacking](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/cli-reference.html#kit-unpack):** Unpack only what you need from a ModelKit with the `kit unpack --filter` command - just the model, just the dataset and code, or any other combination.
* ü§ñ **[Automation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kit-cli):** Pack or unpack a ModelKit locally or as part of your CI/CD workflow for testing, integration, or deployment.
* ü™õ **[LLM fine-tuning](https://dev.to/kitops/fine-tune-your-first-large-language-model-llm-with-lora-llamacpp-and-kitops-in-5-easy-steps-1g7f):** Use KitOps to fine-tune a large language model using LoRA.
* üéØ **[RAG pipelines](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5384392/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Building-and-Distributing):** Create a RAG pipeline for tailoring an LLM with KitOps.
* üìù **[Artifact signing](https://kitops.ml/docs/next-steps.html):** ModelKits and their assets can be signed so you can be confident of their provenance.
* üåà **[Standards-based](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/compatibility.html):** Store ModelKits in any OCI 1.1-compliant container or artifact registry.
* ü•ß **[Simple syntax](https://kitops.ml/docs/kitfile/kf-overview.html):** Kitfiles are easy to write and read, using a familiar YAML syntax.
* ü©∞ **[Flexible](https://kitops.ml/docs/kitfile/format.html#model):** Reference base models using `model parts`, or store key-value pairs (or any YAML-compatible JSON data) in your Kitfile - use it to keep features, hyperparameters, links to MLOps tool experiments, or validation output.
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è **[Run locally](./docs/src/docs/dev-mode.md):** Kit's Dev Mode lets you run an LLM locally, configure it, and prompt/chat with it instantly.
* ü§ó **Universal:** ModelKits can be used with any AI, ML, or LLM project - even multi-modal models.
* üê≥ **Deploy containers:** Generate a Docker container as part of your `kit unpack` (coming soon).
* üö¢ **Kubernetes-ready:** Generate a Kubernetes / KServe deployment config as part of your `kit unpack` (coming soon).

## üöÄ Try KitOps in under 15 Minutes

1. [Install the CLI](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/installation.html) for your platform.
2. Follow the [Getting Started](https://kitops.ml/docs/get-started.html) docs to learn to pack, unpack, and share a ModelKit.
3. Test drive one of our [ModelKit Quick Starts](https://jozu.ml/organization/jozu-quickstarts) that includes everything you need to run your model including a codebase, dataset, documentation, and of course the model.

For those who prefer to build from the source, follow [these steps](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/installation.html#üõ†Ô∏è-install-from-source) to get the latest version from our repository.

## What is in the box?

**[ModelKit](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/intro.html):** At the heart of KitOps is the ModelKit, an OCI-compliant packaging format for sharing all AI project artifacts: datasets, code, configurations, and models. By standardizing the way these components are packaged, versioned, and shared, ModelKits facilitate a more streamlined and collaborative development process that is compatible with any MLOps or DevOps tool.

**[Kitfile](https://kitops.ml/docs/kitfile/kf-overview.html):** A ModelKit is defined by a Kitfile - your AI/ML project's blueprint. It uses YAML to describe where to find each of the artifacts that will be packaged into the ModelKit. The Kitfile outlines what each part of the project is.

**[Kit CLI](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/cli-reference.html):** The Kit CLI not only enables users to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits -- it lets you pull only the pieces you need. Just need the serialized model for deployment? Use `unpack --model`, or maybe you just want the training datasets? `unpack --datasets`.
