### What is KitOps?

KitOps is a packaging and versioning system for AI/ML projects that uses open standards so it works with the AI/ML, development, and DevOps tools you are already using, and can be stored in your enterprise registry.

KitOps simplifies the handoffs between data scientists, application developers, and SREs working with LLMs and other AI/ML models. KitOps' ModelKits are an OCI-compliant package for models, their dependencies, configurations, and codebases. ModelKits are portable, reproducible, and work with the tools you already use.

Teams and enterprises use KitOps to speed up and de-risk all types of AI projects from small analysis models to large language models, including fine-tuning and RAG.

### Features

* üéÅ **[Unified packaging](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/intro.html):** A ModelKit package includes models, datasets, configurations, and code. Add as much or as little as your project needs.
* üè≠ **[Versioning](https://kitops.ml/docs/cli/cli-reference.html#kit-tag):** Each ModelKit is tagged so everyone knows which dataset and model work together.
* ü§ñ **[Automation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kit-cli):** Pack or unpack a ModelKit locally or as part of your CI/CD workflow for testing, integration, or deployment.
* ü™õ **[LLM fine-tuning](https://dev.to/kitops/fine-tune-your-first-large-language-model-llm-with-lora-llamacpp-and-kitops-in-5-easy-steps-1g7f):** Use KitOps to fine-tune a large language model using LoRA.
* üéØ **RAG pipelines:** Create a RAG pipeline for tailoring an LLM with KitOps.
* üîí **[Tamper-proofing](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/spec.html):** Each ModelKit package includes a SHA digest for itself, and every artifact it holds.
* üåà **[Standards-based](https://kitops.ml/docs/modelkit/compatibility.html):** Store ModelKits in any container or artifact registry.
* ü•ß **[Simple syntax](https://kitops.ml/docs/kitfile/kf-overview.html):** Kitfiles are easy to write and read, using a familiar YAML syntax.
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è **Run locally:** Kit's Dev Mode lets your run an LLM locally, configure it, and prompt/chat with it instantly (coming soon).
* üìù **Signed packages:** ModelKits and their assets can be signed so you can be confident of their provenance.
* üê≥ **Deploy containers:** Generate a Docker container as part of your `kit unpack` (coming soon).
* üö¢ **Kubernetes-ready:** Generate a Kubernetes / KServe deployment config as part of your `kit unpack` (coming soon).
* ü§ó **Flexible:** ModelKits can be used with any AI, ML, or LLM project - even multi-modal models.

### What is in the box?

**[ModelKit](./docs/src/docs/modelkit/intro.md):** At the heart of KitOps is the ModelKit, an OCI-compliant packaging format for sharing all AI project artifacts: datasets, code, configurations, and models. By standardizing the way these components are packaged, versioned, and shared, ModelKits facilitate a more streamlined and collaborative development process that is compatible with any MLOps or DevOps tool.

**[Kitfile](./docs/src/docs/kitfile/kf-overview.md):** A ModelKit is defined by a Kitfile - your AI/ML project's blueprint. It uses YAML to describe where to find each of the artifacts that will be packaged into the ModelKit. Reading the Kitfile gives you a quick understanding of what's involved in each AI project.

**[Kit CLI](./docs/src/docs/cli/cli-reference.md):** The Kit CLI not only enables users to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits -- it lets you pull only the pieces you need. Just need the serialized model for deployment? Use `unpack --model`, or maybe you just want the training datasets? `unpack --datasets`.
