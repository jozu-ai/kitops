# Kit


## Description

`kit` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the packaging, versioning, and distribution of AI/ML models as OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifacts. By leveraging the familiar workflow of containerization platforms like Docker, `kit` enables data scientists and AI developers to encapsulate their models along with all necessary dependencies, configurations, and environments into a standardized, portable format. This facilitates easy sharing and deployment across diverse computing environments, ensuring that models are readily usable without compatibility issues. `kit` supports a wide range of AI/ML frameworks, offers robust version control for model iterations, integrates security practices for safe distribution, and provides a seamless connection to model repositories for storing and retrieving models. With `kit`, the aim is to streamline the end-to-end lifecycle of AI/ML model management, making it as effortless as managing containerized applications.
