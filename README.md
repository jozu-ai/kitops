## Unleashing the Power of Streamlined Collaboration for AI/ML Projects

KitOps is your ultimate toolkit for transforming how you build, package, and deploy AI/ML models. Designed to enhance collaboration among data scientists, application developers, and SREs working on developing, integrating or managing self-hosted AI/ML models. KitOps simplifies bundling models with their dependencies, configurations, and environments into a standardized, portable package. Say goodbye to compatibility concerns and hello to smooth model sharing.

### What is in the box?

**ModelKit:** At the heart of KitOps is the ModelKit, an OCI-compliant packaging format that enables the seamless sharing of all necessary artifacts involved in the AI/ML model lifecycle. This includes datasets, code, configurations, and the models themselves. By standardizing the way these components are packaged, ModelKit facilitates a more streamlined and collaborative development process that is compatible with nearly any tool.

**Kitfile:** Complementing the ModelKit is the Kitfile, AI/ML project's blueprint, a YAML-based configuration file that simplifies the sharing of model, dataset, and code configurations. The Kitfile is designed with both ease of use and security in mind, ensuring that configurations can be efficiently packaged and shared without compromising on safety or governance.

**Kit CLI:** Your magic wand for AI/ML collaboration. The Kit CLI is a powerful tool that enables users to create, manage, run, and deploy ModelKits using Kitfiles. Whether you are packaging a new model for development or deploying an existing model into production, the Kit CLI provides the necessary commands and functionalities to streamline your workflow.

KitOps enhances the end-to-end lifecycle of AI/ML model management, making it as streamlined as managing containerized applications. It's about enhancing collaboration, streamlining processes, and unlocking a world of possibilities for AI/ML innovation.

## Quick Start with Kit

Dive into the world of KitOps with ease! Whether you're looking to streamline your AI/ML workflows or explore the power of ModelKits, getting started with Kit is straightforward.

### Running Kit with Pre-built Binaries


Get started with the Kit CLI by downloading a pre-built binary. Choose the `latest` [tagged version](https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops/tags) for the most stable release, or explore the `next` tag for our development builds.

For installation instructions and selecting the right binary for your platform, please refer to our [Installation Guide](./docs/src/docs/cli/installation.md).

To launch Kit, simply open a terminal and type:

```shell
kit
```
This command will display a list of available actions to supercharge your AI/ML projects.

### Building Kit from Source

For those who prefer to build from the source, follow these steps to get the latest version directly from our repository:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the KitOps source code to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops.git
cd kitops
```

2. Build the Kit CLI: Compile the source code into an executable named kit:
```shell
go build -o kit
```

3. Run Your Build: Execute the built CLI to see all available commands:

```shell
./kit
```

Or, for direct execution during development:

```shell
go run .
```
