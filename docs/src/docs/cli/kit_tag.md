## kit tag

Create a tag that refers to a modelkit

### Synopsis

Create or update a tag <target-modelkit> that refers to <source-modelkit>

This command assigns a new tag to an existing modelkit (source-modelkit) or 
updates an existing tag, effectively renaming or categorizing modelkits for 
better organization and version control. Tags are identifiers linked to specific
modelkit versions within a repository.

A full modelkit reference has the following format: 

[HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]/][NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:TAG]

 * HOST: Optional. The registry hostname where the ModelKit is located. Defaults
   to localhost if unspecified. Must follow standard DNS rules 
   (excluding underscores).

 * PORT_NUMBER: Optional. Specifies the registry's port number if a hostname is 
   provided.

 * NAMESPACE: Represents a user or organization's namespace, consisting of 
   slash-separated components that may include lowercase letters, digits, and 
   specific separators (periods, underscores, hyphens).
 
 * REPOSITORY: The name of the repository, typically corresponding to the 
   modelkit's name.

 * TAG: A human-readable identifier for the modelkit version or variant. Valid 
   ASCII characters include lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, underscores,
   periods, and hyphens. It cannot start with a period or hyphen and is limited 
   to 128 characters.

Tagging is a powerful way to manage different versions or configurations of your
modelkits, making it easier to organize, retrieve, and deploy specific 
iterations. Ensure tags are meaningful and consistent across your team or 
organization to maintain clarity and avoid confusion.
