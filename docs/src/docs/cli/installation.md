# Installing Kit

Kit is a command line tool for building and managing secure and shareable ModelKits. It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.

This page includes instructions for:

* Installing on [MacOS](#üçé-macos-install) with Brew or ZIP
* Installing on [Windows](#ü™ü-windows-install) with ZIP
* Installing on [Linux](#üêß-linux-install) with Brew or TAR
* Building from the [source code](#üõ†Ô∏è-build-from-source-code)

## üçé MacOS Install

The simplest way to install Kit on a Mac is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). You can also install from [ZIP](#mac-install-from-zip).

### Mac Brew Install

1. Open a Terminal window
1. At the prompt type: `brew tap jozu-ai/kitops` (if that doesn't work use the [ZIP instructions](#mac-install-from-zip)
1. When the previous command completes, type `brew install kitops`

You can verify that `kit` is correctly installed by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing:

```shell
kit version
```

This command should display the version number of the Kit CLI you have installed, indicating that the installation was successful.

Now follow our [Quick Start](/docs/get-started.md) to learn how to pack and share your first ModelKit.

## üêß Linux Install

The simplest way to install Kit on Linux is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). You can also install from [TAR](#linux-tar-install).

### Linux Brew Install

1. Open a Terminal window
1. At the prompt type: `brew tap jozu-ai/kitops` (if that doesn't work use the [TAR instructions](#linux-tar-install)
1. When the previous command completes, type `brew install kitops`

You can verify that `kit` is correctly installed by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing:

```shell
kit version
```

The Kit download will happen _so quickly_ on a fast connection that you might miss it...

Open a terminal window in your downloads location and look for a file that starts with `kitops-linux`.

Use the `tar` command to extract the downloaded file. For example, if you downloaded the `kitops-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` file, you would use the following command:

```shell
tar -xzvf kitops-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Move the extracted `kit` executable to a location in your system's PATH. A common choice is `/usr/local/bin`. You can do this with the `mv` command (this may require administrator privileges):

```
sudo mv kit /usr/local/bin/
```

After installation, you can verify that `kit` is correctly installed by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing:

```shell
kit version
```

This command should display the version number of the Kit CLI you have installed, indicating that the installation was successful.

Now follow our [Quick Start](../get-started.md) to learn how to pack and share your first ModelKit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source Code

For those who prefer or require building `kit` from the source code, this section will guide you through the necessary steps.

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- A recent version of Go

You can check if you have Go installed by running `go version` in your terminal. If you need to install Go, visit the [official Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/) for instructions.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the `kitops` GitHub repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run:


```shell
git clone https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops.git
cd kitops
```

This command clones the repository and changes your current directory to the cloned repository's root.

### Build Sources

Once inside the `kitops` directory, you can build the `kit` tool using the Go compiler. Run:

```shell
go build -o kit
```

This command compiles the source code into an executable named `kit`. If you are on Windows, you might want to name the executable `kit.exe`.

### Install the Executable

After the build process completes, you need to move the `kit` executable to a location in your system's PATH to make it accessible from anywhere in the terminal:

#### For MacOS and Linux:

```shell
sudo mv kit /usr/local/bin/
```

#### For Windows:

Move `kit.exe` to a directory that's included in your system's PATH variable. This step may vary based on your specific Windows setup.

### Verify the Installation

To verify that `kit` was installed successfully, open a new terminal window and type:

```shell
kit version
```

## Optional: Set Your Environment

You can configure which directory credentials and storage are located:
* `--config` flag for a specific kit CLI execution
* `KITOPS_HOME` environment variable for permanent configurations

If the `KITOPS_HOME` is set in various places the order of precedence is:
1. `--config` flag, if specified
1. `$KITOPS_HOME` environment variable, if set
1. A default OS-dependent value:
    
    Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kitops`, falling back to `~/.local/share/kitops`
    
    Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\kitops`
    
    Darwin: `~/Library/Caches/kitops`
