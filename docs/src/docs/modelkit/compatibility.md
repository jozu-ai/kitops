# Compatible Tools

The KitOps project is about smoothing the transition from AI/ML teams to production operations teams. We're not trying to change the tools each use, Kit just creates a package that every team can use with their preferred toolset.

Kit packages up everything your AI/ML model needs to be integrated with application (or other models), run locally, or deployed to inference infrastructure. We use standards like JSON, YAML, OCI-assets, and TAR files so nearly everything is compatible with a ModelKit. This includes both common ML tools and standard DevOps toolchains.
