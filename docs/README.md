## Introduction

This documentation has been built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

## Development

To get started with our, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* Node.js (v18.x or higher)
* npm or pnpm package manager

For local development, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is preferred as package manager.

### Running locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the docs directory:
   ```sh
   cd docs
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   pnpm docs:dev
   ```

The documentation should now be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building and previewing

To build the docs (from .md to .html):

```sh
pnpm docs:build
```

And to serve the builds files (preview):

```sh
pnpm docs:preview
```

This will serve the just built files in port `4173`, so you go to `http://localhost:4173` to see exactly what will be served once built and deployed.
