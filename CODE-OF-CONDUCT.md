# Code of Conduct

As project contributors, maintainers, and participants, we pledge to foster an open, inclusive, and welcoming community by respecting everyone who participates or contributes. This includes, but is not limited to, reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, attending conferences or events, or engaging in other community or project activities.

We are committed to ensuring that participation in the project is a positive, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, experience level, family structure, gender, gender identity and expression, marital status, military or veteran status, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, tribe, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:
- Within all official project and community spaces, including online platforms and physical locations.
- In other contexts where the actions or statements of a project participant could impact the project, its community, or another participant, even if outside the official spaces.

## Our Standards

We strive to create an open and respectful environment. Every participant should feel empowered to engage and contribute without fear of discrimination or harassment.

### Examples of Encouraged Behavior:
- Demonstrating empathy, patience, and kindness to all members of the community.
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences, even in disagreement.
- Welcoming constructive criticism with humility and openness.
- Owning mistakes and taking responsibility for learning from them.
- Prioritizing the best interests of the community over personal benefit.
- Using welcoming, inclusive, and respectful language that promotes collaboration.

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior:
- Using offensive, derogatory, or sexualized language and imagery.
- Personal attacks, trolling, insults, or targeted harassment, including malicious or unfounded accusations.
- Public or private harassment, including threats, intimidation, or persistent unwanted contact.
- Publishing personal or sensitive information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without explicit consent.
- Encouraging violence or threatening harm toward others.
- Unwelcome physical contact or inappropriate advances of a sexual or romantic nature.
- Exclusionary behaviors such as gatekeeping, condescending remarks, or dismissing others based on their background or identity.
- Engaging in any behavior that a reasonable person would consider inappropriate in a professional setting.

The following behaviors are also prohibited:
- Providing false or misleading information in connection with a Code of Conduct investigation, or attempting to tamper with such investigations.
- Retaliating against anyone who reports an incident or serves as a witness.

## Reporting and Resolution

If you experience or witness any inappropriate behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project's [Code of Conduct Response Team](mailto:conduct@jozu.com). All reports will be handled promptly and with discretion. We commit to responding to all reports within three business days, though resolution timelines may vary based on the complexity of the situation.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Project maintainers hold the responsibility of maintaining a healthy environment and reserve the right to take action when the Code of Conduct is violated. Such actions may include, but are not limited to:
- Issuing warnings or temporary suspensions.
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that violate this Code.
- Permanent removal from the project community or related spaces.
- Escalating serious cases to higher authorities if necessary (e.g., legal enforcement).

The severity of any consequences will be determined based on the nature of the violation, prior conduct, and the potential impact on the community.

## Restorative Actions

Where appropriate, and in alignment with the severity of the offense, restorative or educational measures may be pursued instead of punitive actions. This could include mediated discussions, sensitivity training, or public apologies to help reintegrate individuals into the community after behavioral issues are addressed.
