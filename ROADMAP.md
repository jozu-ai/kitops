## Roadmap Themes

### UX Improvements

* [Pack and convert](https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops/issues/564) models directly from Hugging Face

### Deployment

Users want to be able to deploy their models through existing CI/CD/CT pipelines. Since KitOps doesn't know the details of a user's deployment pipeline or process we will `unpack` a ModelKit into an appropriate directory structure for one of several deployment targets.

* [Enhance unpack for deployment-specific directory structures](https://github.com/jozu-ai/kitops/issues/131)

### CLI Distribution

Users want to be able to get the Kit CLI from locations like Brew, Choco, and Conda.

* [Install with Brew](https://kitops.org/docs/cli/installation.html)
* Use KitOps with our Python SDK
* Add support for Choco
* Add support for Conda

### Attestation

This feature will come in two parts: build attestation and self-attestation. Build attestations will be done by KitOps itself, adding a SLSA attestation about how the ModelKit was built. ModelKit creators can add an optional attestation for specific assets in the ModelKit, or the whole ModelKit. Users can include any 3rd party attestation Verification Summary Attestation (VSA). Additional attestations could be added as predicates. Attestation would be included as a separate layer in the ModelKit.

* Add provenance for KitOps ModelKit builds
* Add CLI warnings if attestation was expected and not found

### Signing

Users can optionally sign their ModelKit using something like Cosign in order to add an extra layer of security to their packaging.

* Add docs on signing and verifying to docs

### Kit Dev

* Kit Dev: Generate example code as the parameters and prompts are entered
* Kit Dev: A way to see JSON communicated between the server and responses
* Kit Dev: Hide parameters that are not frequently changed
